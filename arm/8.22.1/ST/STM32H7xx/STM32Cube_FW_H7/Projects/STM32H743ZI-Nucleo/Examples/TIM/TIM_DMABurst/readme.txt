@par Example Description 

This example shows how to update the TIMER channel1 period and the duty cycle 
using the TIMER DMA burst feature.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz 
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz

Every update DMA request, the DMA will do 3 transfers of half words into Timer 
registers beginning from ARR register.
On the DMA update request, 0x0FFF will be transferred into ARR, 0x0000 
will be transferred into RCR (if supported), 0x0555 will be transferred into CCR1. 

The TIM2CLK frequency is set to (2*PCLK1 = HCLK), to get TIM2 counter
clock at 20 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
- Prescaler = (TIM2CLK / TIM2 counter clock) - 1

The TIM2 Frequency = TIM2 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                   = 20 MHz / 4096 = 4.88 KHz

The TIM2 CCR1 register value is equal to 0x555, so the TIM2 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 4.88 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 33.33%:
TIM2 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM2_CCR1/ TIM2_ARR + 1)* 100 = 33.33%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32H743xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H743ZI-Nucleo 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32H743ZI-Nucleo Set-up
    - Connect the TIM2 output channel to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms: 
    - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00 Pin28 of CN11)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

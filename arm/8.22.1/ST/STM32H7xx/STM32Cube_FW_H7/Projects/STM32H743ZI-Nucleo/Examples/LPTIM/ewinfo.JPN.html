<b>LPTIM_Encoder</b>
Example
=====================================================================================

<u>Example Description</u>

This example shows how to configure the LPTIM peripheral in Encoder mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

In this example, the LPTIM encoder is configured to generate up or down counting
according to the phase between the two inputs of LPTIM1.

In this exemple :

        - At the first there is no change of state , LED1 &amp; LED3 are Off .
        - If LED3 On and LED1 Off , the LPTIM encoder mode is in up counting   .
        - If LED1 On and LED3 Off , the LPTIM encoder is mode in down counting .
        - In case of error , LED1 &amp; LED 3 On

To change the direction of counting switch the inputs 1 &amp; 2 of LPTIM1.

Note: Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

Note: The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

<b>LPTIM_PulseCounter</b>
Low power timer pulse counter example
=====================================================================================

<u>Example Description</u>

This example describes how to configure and use LPTIM to count pulses through
the LPTIM HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

To reduce power consumption, MCU enters stop mode after starting counting. Each
time the counter reachs the maximum value (Period/Autoreload), an interruption
is generated, the MCU is woke up from stop mode and LED1 toggles the last state.

In this example Period value is set to 1000, so each time the counter counts
(1000 + 1) rising edges on LPTIM1_IN1 pin, an interrupt is generated and LED1
toggles.

In this example the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 is LSI (32 Khz),
so the external input is sampled with LSI clock. In order not to miss any event,
the frequency of the changes on the external Input1 signal should never exceed the
frequency of the internal clock provided to the LPTIM1 (LSI for the
present example).

Note: Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

Note: The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

<b>LPTIM_PWMExternalClock</b>
LPTIM PWM External clock example
=====================================================================================

<u>Example Description</u>

This example describes how to configure and use LPTIM to generate a PWM at the
lowest power consumption, using an external counter clock, through the HAL LPTIM API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The Autorelaod equal to 99 so the output frequency (OutputFrequency) will
be equal to the external counter clock (InputFrequency) divided by (99+1).

  OutputFrequency = InputFrequency / (Autoreload + 1)
                  = InputFrequency / 100

Pulse value equal to 49 and the duty cycle (DutyCycle) is computed as follow:

  DutyCycle = 1 - [(PulseValue + 1)/ (Autoreload + 1)]
  DutyCycle = 50%

To minimize the power consumption, after starting generating the PWM signal,
the MCU enters in STOP mode. Note that GPIOs are configured in Low Speed to
lower the consumption.

User push-button pin (PC.13)is configured as input with external interrupt (EXTI_Line15_10),
falling edge. When User push-button is pressed, wakeup event is generated and PWM signal
generation is stopped.

Note: Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

Note: The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

<b>LPTIM_PWM_LSE</b>
LPTIM PWM Low Power example with LSE clock source
=====================================================================================

<u>Example Description</u>

This example describes how to configure and use LPTIM to generate a PWM in low power mode
using the LSE as a counter clock, through the HAL LPTIM API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

In this example, the LPTIM instance used is LPTIM1 and the low power mode is Stop mode.

The counter clock is LSE (32.768 KHz), Autoreload equal to 99 so the output
frequency (FrequencyOutput) will be equal to 327.680.

  FrequencyOutput = Counter Clock Frequency / (Autoreload + 1)
                  = 32768 / 100
                  = 327.680 Hz

Pulse value equal to 49 and the duty cycle (DutyCycle) is computed as follow:

  DutyCycle = 1 - ((PulseValue + 1)/ (Autoreload + 1))
  DutyCycle = 50%

To minimize the power consumption, after starting generating the PWM signal,
the MCU enters in Stop mode. Note that GPIOs are configured in Low Speed to
enhance the consumption.

User push-button pin (PC.13)is configured as input with external interrupt (EXTI_Line15_10),
falling edge. When User push-button is pressed, wakeup event is generated and PWM signal
generation is stopped.

Note: Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then

      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

Note: The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

<b>LPTIM_Timeout</b>
LPTIM Timeout example with LSE clock source
=====================================================================================

<u>Example Description</u>

This example describes how to implement a low power timeout to wake-up the
system using the LPTIMER, through the HAL LPTIM API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32H743xx Devices :
The CPU at 400MHz
The HCLK for D1 Domain AXI and AHB3 peripherals , D2 Domain AHB1/AHB2 peripherals and D3 Domain AHB4  peripherals at 200MHz.
The APB clock dividers for D1 Domain APB3 peripherals, D2 Domain APB1 and APB2 peripherals and D3 Domain APB4 peripherals to  run at 100MHz.

The main() function configures the LPTIMER and goes in STOP mode.
In order to start the timer a first trigger is needed on (PG.14)(LPTIM_ETR).
Any successive trigger event on (PG.14) will reset the counter and the timer
will restart. The timeout value corresponds to the compare value (32768).
If after the first trigger no other trigger occurs within the expected time frame,
the MCU is woken-up by the compare match event and LED2 toggles.

In this example the LPTIM is clocked by the LSI

  Timeout = (Compare + 1) / LPTIM_Clock
          = (32767 + 1) / LSI_Clock_Frequency

Once the system is woken up it remains in run mode. The led keeps toggling each time the timer expires.

Note: Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

Note: The example need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

  - Connect an external trigger (ETR) to PG.14(pin61 CN12 connector ).
    If the trigger is higher then 1Hz, the counter is regularly reset, the system stays in STOP mode.
    If the trigger is lower then 1Hz, the counter expires and the system is woken up.
